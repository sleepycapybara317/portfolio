    <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
            Through this project, I designed and developed a local coffee shop's
            menu and ordering interface using React.
        </p>

    <h2>Usability Principles</h2>
    <p>
        In addition to sharpening my React skills, I focused on creating a site that was highly usable
        by implementing the following usability principles:
        <ol>
            <li>Layout: My layout encourages a reading path and I put action 
                buttons at the end of the up-to-down scan pattern of each 
                container. For example, the "Add to Cart" and "Remove from Cart" 
                buttons are located at the bottom of each drink card. Similarly, 
                the reset button is located at the bottom of the container of 
                filters and sorting options.</li>
            <li>
                Heirarchy: I used grouping to segment the screen into 3 
                sections: the drink cards, the filter/sorting container, and 
                the cart. All of the drink cards are aligned in one column 
                and' have equivalent headings, colors, and formatting to show 
                that they are equivalent. Within the filter/sorting container, 
                the possible filters and sorting types are explicitly grouped 
                through an enclosure.
            </li>
            <li>
                Consistency: My website also has consistency: all the filters 
                are done with checkboxes, sorting with radio buttons, and 
                other buttons with the same style type in which they can be 
                hovered and clicked. This promotes learnability.
            </li>
        </ol>
    </p>

    <h2>Sorting & Filtering</h2>
        <p>
            Through this project, I learned how to code sorting and filtering algorithms
            in React! Although it took some time to master, it was a great way to better
            understand how to use React components and Hooks.

        </p>
    
    <h2>The Final Product</h2>
        <p>
            Overall, I was really pleased with how much React development I was able to learn
            over the course of this project. I am excited to continue to code in the platform!
        </p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    Although it was tricky to design for an artist, this project was extremely rewarding.
    It not only allowed me to better understand how to stay true to someone else's vision,
    but it allowed me to make an impact by amplifying
    the local director's reach.
